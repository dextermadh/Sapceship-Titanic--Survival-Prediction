# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic - Passenger Transportation Prediction

Welcome to the year **2912**, where a data science mission awaits!  
The *Spaceship Titanic*, a luxury interstellar liner, collided with a hidden spacetime anomaly near **Alpha Centauri**.  
As a result, nearly half of its 13,000 passengers were mysteriously transported to an alternate dimension.

🎯 **Mission**:  
Analyze the recovered spaceship data and build predictive models to determine which passengers were transported.  
Your predictions could help rescue crews retrieve the lost souls and change history!
